Dear <TAL_REALNAME>,

As you may have already noticed, we do not have a standard e-mail address
format in our server (mail.foo.com). This has been causing inconvenience
even among us.

In order to solve this problem, we have come up with four standardized
dummy e-mail addresses which will serve exactly as your original e-mail
address (<TAL_USERNAME>@mail.foo.com>).

Here is your dummy e-mail addresses:

	1.  <TAL_DOTED_REALNAME>@mail.foo.com

	2.  <TAL_FIRSTNAME>@mail.foo.com

	3.  <TAL_LASTNAME>@mail.foo.com

	4.  <TAL_LASTNAME><TAL_1ST_CHAR_FIRSTNAME>@mail.foo.com


NOT: Please don't try to login to terminals or POP server with these addresses,
     they are good only for e-mail.

Best Regards, FOO System Administrator <operator@mail.foo.com>
